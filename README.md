**TC32-Ethernet-Qt-C++-Driver-Library v1.0.0**

A Qt C++ modified port of an open source C driver for the MCC TC-32 written by Warren Jasper and housed at the repo:
https://github.com/org-arl/MCC_Linux_Drivers/tree/master/Ethernet/c
This port expands system compatibility along with moving towards support for automated collection and multithreaded operation in order to leverage the jump to C++.

**Notes on Licensing**

As with the original version, this is released under the GNU lesser general public license and as such, it may be used in any other project you deem fit but comes with no guaranteed support or functionality. Furthermore if this code is modified, that code will also need to be released (as I'm doing here) under the same license.
